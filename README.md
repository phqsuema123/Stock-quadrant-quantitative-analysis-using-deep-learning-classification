# ðŸ“Š Stock Quadrant Quantitative Analysis Using Deep Learning

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project develops an **AI-powered stock classification system** that categorizes Thai stocks into **25 quadrants (Aaâ€“Ee)** based on:

* **Fundamental strength** (EPS, PE, PBV, Dividend Yield, Market Cap)
* **Market trend** (RSI, EMA5â€“200, volatility, etc.)

The goal is to assist investors in analyzing stocks **systematically, quickly, and accurately** through quantitative deep learning models.
